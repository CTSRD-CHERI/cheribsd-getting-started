# Getting help

CheriBSD is a community-supported open-source research operating system.
While every effort has been made to engineer to a high quality, many aspects
of OS design for CHERI processors remain active research, and there are
constrained engineering resources available to build, maintain, and support
the system.
As you gain experience with CheriBSD, your help in supporting newcomers in the
community will be greatly appreciated.

## GitHub issue tracker and pull requests

CheriBSD is developed and maintained in the [CheriBSD GitHub
repository](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd), which includes an issue
tracker in which bugs can be reported, as well as permitting pull requests to
be submitted.

This document is also mained in a [GitHub
Repository](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd-getting-started), and your
feedback and improvements would be very much appreciated.

## CheriBSDÂ Slack on cheri-cpu.slack.com

Support for CheriBSD is provided via the [CHERI CPU
Slack](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-slack.html),
where a number of topic-specific channels can be found:
* `#cheribsd`;

  CheriBSD, its features, releases and future plans.

* `#debuggers`;

  GDB extended to support CHERI.

* `#qemu`;

  QEMU-CHERI, QEMU system and user modes for Morello and CHERI-RISC-V.

* `#software-porting`.

  Third-party software adaptations to CheriABI and CHERI-enabled achitectures,
  CheriBSD ports and Poudriere.

## CheriBSD mailing lists

There are also several CheriBSD email lists available:

- [CheriBSD announcement mailing list (low volume)](https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/info/cl-cheribsd-announce)
- [CheriBSD general discussion](https://lists.cam.ac.uk/sympa/info/cl-cheribsd-discuss)
- CheriBSD security vulnerabilities contact address [cl-cheribsd-security@lists.cam.ac.uk](mailto:cl-cheribsd-security@lists.cam.ac.uk) 

## In-person events and meetings

You can meet with the CheriBSD developers at a number of conferences and other
events, including:

- UKRI Digital Security by Design (DSbD) All Hands meetings that take place in
  the UK twice annually to discuss the Morello architecture, board, and its
  use.

- FreeBSD developer summits and conferences around the world, including (when
  it takes place) the BSDCan conference in Canada, and the EuroBSDCon
  conference in Europe.

There is discussion around creating further, more frequent CHERI workshops in
the UK in the future.

Most CheriBSD developers are based at the University of Cambridge (UK) and SRI
International (USA), and it is possible to set up meetings with them directly.
Get in touch if this would be useful to you.
