# Getting CheriBSD support

CheriBSD is a community-supported open-source research operating system.
While every effort has been made to engineer to a high quality, many aspects
of OS design for CHERI processors remain active research, and there are
constrained engineering resources available to build, maintain, and support
the system.
As you gain experience with CheriBSD, your help in supporting newcomers in the
community will be greatly appreciated.

##Â CHERI-CPU Slack

Support for CheriBSD is provided via the [CHERI CPU
Slack](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/security/ctsrd/cheri/cheri-slack.html),
where there is a `#cheribsd` channel where many of the CheriBSD developers
and many CheriBSD users can be found.

## CheriBSD mailing lists

There are also several CheriBSD email lists available:

- CheriBSD announcement mailing list (low volume) **XXX: To update**
- CheriBSD general discussion **XXX: To update**
- CheriBSD security vulnerabilities contact address **XXX: To update**

## In-person events

Further, you can meet with the CheriBSD developers at a number of conferences
and other events, including the UKRI DSbD All Hands Meetings that take place
twice annually in the UK.
