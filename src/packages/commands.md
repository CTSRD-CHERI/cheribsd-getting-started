# Useful commands

The following list includes useful commands to manage packages.
Replace `<pkg>` with `pkg64c` to execute a command in the context of CheriABI
packages and with `pkg64` in the context of hybrid ABI packages.

Most `pkg` commands have separate man pages describing them.
For a command `<pkg> foo`, you can read its man page by executing `man pkg-foo`
on a CheriBSD host.
