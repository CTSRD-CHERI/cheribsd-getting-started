# CheriABI desktop environment (experimental)

The installer has the option to install a desktop environment using the Mali
Bifrost GPU on the Morello System-on-Chip.
The option installs a basic desktop environment using KDE and Wayland compiled
for CheriABI with the `cheri-desktop` package.
It also installs a hybrid ABI Chromium web browser via the
`cheri-desktop-hybrid-extras` package.
