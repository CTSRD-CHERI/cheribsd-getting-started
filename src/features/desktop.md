# CheriABI desktop environment (experimental)

As of the 22.12 release, the installer has gained the option to install a
desktop environment using the Mali Bifrost GPU on the Morello System-on-Chip.
The option installs a basic desktop environment using KDE and Wayland
compiled for CheriABI with the `cheri-desktop` package.  It also
installs a hybrid ABI Firefox web browser via the `cheri-desktop-hybrid-extras`
package.
