# CheriBSD features

CheriBSD extends FreeBSD with added CHERI-enabled features, such as kernel and
userspace memory safety:

 * [Kernel compilation modes](kernel.md)
 * [Process environments](processes.md)
 * [CheriABI desktop environment (experimental)](desktop.md)
 * [Userlevel heap temporal memory safety (experimental)](temporal.md)
 * [Userlevel software compartmentalization (experimental)](c18n.md)
 * [bhyve hypervisor (experimental)](bhyve.md)

Some of these features are in the main CheriBSD branch; other experimental
features remain on development branches.
