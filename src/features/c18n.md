# Userlevel software compartmentalization (experimental)

CheriBSD implements two different
CHERI-enabled software compartmentalization models:

- **Colocated processes (co-processes) compartmentalization** accelerates
  UNIX Inter-Process Communication (IPC) and context switching by colocating
  multiple processes in the same address space, separating them using CHERI
  capabilities.  Support for co-processes is maintained in an experimental
  development branch and is not included in current software releases.
  For more information see the [Colocation Tutorial](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheripedia/wiki/Colocation-Tutorial)
  wiki page.
- **Dynamic-linker-based compartmentalization** isolates shared libraries
  within a process using CHERI capabilities limiting the access of attackers
  who have achieved arbitrary code execution within a library.
  The linker-based library compartmentalization model has been included since
  the 22.12 release of CheriBSD.
  See the compartmentalization(7) manual page on an installed system for more
  information.
