# Unsupported FreeBSD features

Certain FreeBSD features are currently unavailable in CheriBSD, including:

- ZFS
- DTrace

Many other kernel features are not yet well validated, including:

- Non-UFS file systems
- Most optional modules, such as various firewall systems

Bug reports relating to these under-validated subsystems would be appreciated,
and may be submitted to the [CheriBSD GitHub issue
tracker](https://github.com/CTSRD-CHERI/cheribsd/issues).
