# Downloading CheriBSD image files

Memstick and live images can both be downloaded from the [CheriBSD
website](https://www.cheribsd.org/).
Images are compressed using the UNIX `xz` command, and must be decompressed
before they can be used; for example by running:

```
unxz cheribsd-memstick-dev-arm64-aarch64c-2022-04-05.img.xz
````
